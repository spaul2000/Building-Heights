main.sh 

This script will run the preprocessing of our main Texas dataset. This entails downloading the dataset from GCP. 
The script will then run training of our ViT dual encoder model on the downloaded dataset. Finally, the script will run testing of the model on the downloaded dataset.

We don't allow users to modify arguments specifically in main.sh since that would massively increase complexity. 
If a user wants to change any of the default arguments passed into code/preprocess/preprocess.py and code/height_estimation.py to modify the downloaded dataset, location of the dataset, train or test parameters, 
then they should do so directly in those files.

Additionally, a user can run:

python3 code/preprocess/preprocess.py [flags]

python3 code/height_estimation.py train [save_dir, tb_path, exp_name, seg_architecture, main_backbone, s1_backbone, s2_backbone, seg_dataset, learning_rate, batch_size, loss_fn, optimizer, patience]

python3 code/height_estimation.py test [flags]

separately if they want greater customization.
